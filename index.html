            <p>
                The series focuses on <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_D._Luffy" target="_blank">Monkey D. Luffy</a>, a young man who, inspired by his childhood idol and powerful pirate "Red Haired" Shanks, sets off on a
                journey from the East Blue Sea to find the famed treasure One Piece and proclaim himself the King of the Pirates.

            <p>
                In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy rescues and befriends a swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the One Piece. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a navigator and thief; Usopp, a sniper and
                a liar; and Sanji, a womanizing chef. They acquire a ship named the Going Merry and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates of the East Blue.
            </p>

                As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, a doctor and anthropomorphized reindeer; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright; Brook, a
                skeletal musician and swordsman; and Jinbe, a fishman helmsman; and they also acquire a new ship named the Thousand Sunny.
